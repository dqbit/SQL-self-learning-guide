This is my own code when completing the NY restaurant project on codecadamy.com 
About querying a database in different ways:

------------------------code starts here--------------------------------------


select distinct neighborhood from nomnom;

select distinct cuisine from nomnom;

select * from nomnom
where cuisine is 'Chinese';

select * from nomnom
where review >= 4;


select name,
Case
when review > 4.5 then 'Extrodinary'
when review > 4 then 'Excellent'
when review > 3 then 'Good'
when review > 2 then 'Fair'
else 'Poor'
end as 'Review'
from nomnom
limit 10;


select * from nomnom
where cuisine is 'Italian' 
	and price is '$$$';
  
select * from nomnom
where name like '%meatball%';


select * from nomnom
where neighborhood is 'Midtown' or 'Downtown' or 'Chinatown';

select * from nomnom
where health is null;

select * from nomnom
order by review desc
limit 10;
